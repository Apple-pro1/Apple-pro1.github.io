Using the 5 factor of git
## **Day 3**

On day 3 I created a reposity for a potential blog, and it was intriguing that github noticed my intention of creating a blog. The fundementals of a blog was automatically updated by github. In order to create a blog I used the 5 factors of the git, especially "commit" because I was commiting a new repository. 

To continue the process I had to confirm if "ruby" and "gem" was installed, then I attempted to install "jekyll" and "bundler" as they are crucial resources. However, there was an error: the CLT error. After fixing all errors, I browsed for Jekyll themes, and installed a few. 

Then, I transfered the "index.html" to my personal repository. After initialising a blog, I commited and pushed the file to create a blog, then I created a post .

*Spring Boot:*
I have setup spring boot according to the instructions, unzipping the folder to open it on IntelliJ. Then I learned about the packages, and added them to begin my API session.
