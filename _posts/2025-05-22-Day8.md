# Introduction

Today, I worked on converting my Java backend program into a web service structure to later accept frontend calls from React

## Development Notes

First, I created a new repository structure in order to use spring boot for a Controller-Model-Service structure:

The controller component is resposible for handling incoming requests, which would be the requests from the React frontend in my application

**ClassificationController.java**

For the model component, I created simple entities to build getters and setters to deal with my classifier's data flow from the user and from classifer

**ClassificationRequest.java**

**ClassificationResponse.java**

Finally, I built a service component mostly by mimicking the code structure of my original EUAIActClassifier.java file to perform the main operations of the classifier


[**ClassificationService.java**](https://github.com/baekbyte/AI-Use-Case-Classifier/blob/main/src/main/java/com/euaiact/classifier/service/ClassificationService.java)

I then moved the original EUAIActClassifier.java file to a legacy folder so it doesn't interfere with the Maven build. I also updated the pom.xml file to configure proper dependencies for spring boot
