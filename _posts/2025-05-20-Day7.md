# Introduction

Today, I started working on the frontend application on the AI Risk Classification System by bootstrapping Create React App.

## Development Notes

I began by installing node js in my terminal and then created a new React project with TypeScript support by using the command "create-react-app frontend --template typescript"

Also, using a template made it easier to configure the TypeScript compiler and create necessary dependencies in the package.json file. 

For now, I created a minimum viable application with
- A header with the application name: "AI Use Case Classifier"
- Text input area for entering the text to classify
- Submit button to send the text to the Java backend
- Results display showing the classification results

Moving on, I will work on the backend integration to connect it with the frontend React application.
