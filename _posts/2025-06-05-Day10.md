# Introduction

Today, I worked on creating an API service in the React frontend to handle communication with the backend program

## Development Notes

First of all, I downloaded the axios package to handle requests, and then added dependancies to package.json

I created an API service file to define API request and response types

Then, I created an axios instance with a default configuration

Finally, I created a method to request the classification and fetch it with proper error handling

Next steps would be to work on creating a frontend form component where I can collect the request from the user, use the API service to call the classification request, and then display the results
