# Introduction

Today, I worked on separating the classification form page so the one page takes the system name and purpose while the other page conducts the classification assessment.

## Development Notes

I started with adding another route path for the classifier page which takes the system name and purpose

Then, I edited my landing page so that it directs the user to the classifer page when they click the button

After that, I went to my classifer page and migrated the system name and purpose portion from the classification form

Since the results will now be displayed on a separate page, I stored the results of the parser into a local storage

In the classification form, I first load the location storage so that it can be used for the results

Aside from deleting the redundant portion in the classification form page, I left all the checkbox assessment functions untouched


Moving forward, I will create the basic structure for the remaning pages:
- Landing page &#x2611;
- Page for user to enter system name and purpose &#x2611;
- Loading screen with rotating logo
- Prohibited Assessment
- High-risk Assessment
- Transparency Assessment
- Loading screen with rotating logo
- Recommendations with option to export
