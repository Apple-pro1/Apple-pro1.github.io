$ Process Journal (first person perspective)
- ## **Day 3**

*Github blog:* on day 3 I created a reposity for a potential blog, and it was intriguing that github noticed my intention of creating a blog. Therefore, the fundementals of a blog was automatically updated by github. In order to create a blog I used the 5 factors of the git, especially "commit" because I was commiting a new repository. 

To continue the process I had to confirm if "ruby" and "gem" was installed, then I attempted to install "jekyll" and "bundler" as they are crucial resources. However, there was an inevitable error, but the potential trouble was anticipated by the teacher; therefore, we were able to pursue our tasks without squandering time. Moreover, the problem was exacerbated after another error was induced, the CLT error. After fixing all errors, we browsed for Jekyll themes, and installed the most eligible theme. 

Then, I transfered the "index.html" to my personal repository. After initialising a blog I commited and pushed the file to create a blog. Furthermore, I created a post in order to blog my process journal. 

*Spring Boot:*
I have setup spring boot according to the instructions, unzipping the folder to open it on IntelliJ. Then I learned about the packages, and added them to begin our API session.
