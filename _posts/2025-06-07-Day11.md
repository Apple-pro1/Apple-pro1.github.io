# Introduction

Today, I worked on creating a form component for the front end and adding the yes/no question framework to the program like the prototype/MVP java program I initially created

## Development Notes

First of all, I created a ClassificationForm component for the front end to prompt the user to enter the system name and purpose, and check off questions accordingly. If the user clicks the "Classify System" button, the program shows the results accordingly through the backend code

[**ClassificationForm.tsx**](https://github.com/baekbyte/AI-Use-Case-Classifier/blob/main/frontend/src/components/ClassificationForm.tsx)

Backend-wise, I had to add code to each method to also check for the user's input (check box), such as:

I also created relevant getters and setters in both the ClassificationRequest and ClassificationResponse files so that the service can call on them

With everything set, I can now run the Spring Boot backend server with "./mvnw spring-boot:run" and lauch the React frontend server with "npm start"

Now the program runs on https://localhost:3000

The program parses through the system's purpose to check for certian words to classify the risk level and also take the user's input on the check boxes to classify

**Simulation**

SystemName: SampleAI
SystemPurpose: This ai system is designed as a chatbot to help people with their search

Without checking any boxes the program returns "limited risk" because of the word "chatbot" in the purpose

Moving on, I will work on enhancing the UI/UX of the frontend and migrate the recommendation extraction into a txt.file from the prototype java file into the new code
