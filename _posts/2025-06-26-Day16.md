# Introduction

Today, I worked on migrating the recommendations export function from my EUAIActClassifer.java file to my main code.

## Development Notes

I started with literally copy and pasting over the original method into ClassificationService.java and slighlty changing the parameters

I also migrated this to ClassificationController.java so that it can use postmapping to handle "post" requests

Then, I post the file download on api.ts so that it can be called on the result page

Lastly, I created a method in my results page to handle this download by calling on the api and made a button so the user can download the results

That completes the functionality of this program:
- Landing page &#x2611;
- Page for user to enter system name and purpose &#x2611;
- Prohibited Assessment &#x2611;
- High-risk Assessment &#x2611;
- Transparency Assessment &#x2611;
- Recommendations with option to export &#x2611;

Moving forward, I will work on the UI of this program so that it looks more presentable
