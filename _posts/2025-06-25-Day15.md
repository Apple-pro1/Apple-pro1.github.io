# Introduction

Today, I worked on altering the classification form into a multi-page format, and separating the result page



## Development Notes

I simply started with adding a ResultsPage to the components and importing it to my App file to create a route for it

Then, I revamped the entire ClassificationForm put with a multi-page format for the different assessments. I first created the 3 pages (prohibited, high-risk, and transparency) as constants

I added useEffect to set form data and load data from the local storage

Next, I created handleBack and handleNext so that the user can go back and forth between the different assessments to make edits if necessary

Once the form is submitted, the program navigates to the ResultsPage

Moving forward, I will create the basic structure for the remaning pages:
- Landing page &#x2611;
- Page for user to enter system name and purpose &#x2611;
- Loading screen with rotating logo
- Prohibited Assessment &#x2611;
- High-risk Assessment &#x2611;
- Transparency Assessment &#x2611;
- Loading screen with rotating logo
- Recommendations with option to export
