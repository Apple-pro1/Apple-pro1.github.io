# Introduction

Today, I worked on the css component of the program, debugged some functionalities, and finished creating the web application

## Development Notes

First, I worked on designing the header and the landing page to create a simple layout with the logo and a nav bar with a "home," "classifer," "results" button. I assigned classNames to each components in order to manipulate them separately

Then, I moved on to the classifer page to create a simple card that includes a space for the user to enter the system name and purpose

For the classification form, I created a status bar that shows which section of the form you're completing and what you have complement. Below that, I made a simple container to display the user's input for the system name and purpose

After that, I designed the result page to display the AI system's risk category, compliance status, and recommendations. I also created an option to start a new assessment in case the user needs it

That brings this project to an end. Feel free to check it out in my [github repo](https://github.com/baekbyte/AI-Use-Case-Classifier). I also updated the README file so that it explains the program more comprehensively and outlines instructions to run the code on your localhost server
