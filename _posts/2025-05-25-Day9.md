# Introduction

Today, I continued working on the backend integration process by adding input validation annotations and API documentations

## Development Notes

**Input Validation**

First of all, I added a spring-boot-starter-validation dependency to the pom.xml file

Then, I updated the ClassificationRequest class with valid annotations by using @NotBlank for required fields (e.g. systemName and systemPurpose) and @Size to validate requests

I also modified the controller to use @Valid annotation and added an exception handler that returns HTTP 400 for bad requests and error messages

**API Documentation**

First, I added a springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui dependency to the pom.xml file

Added documentation to the controller by using @Tag for API grouping, @Operation for endpoint description, and @ApiResponses for possible responses
