# Introduction

Today, I continued working on the backend integration process by adding input validation annotations and API documentations

## Development Notes

**Input Validation**

First of all, I added a spring-boot-starter-validation dependency to the pom.xml file

Then, I updated the ClassificationRequest class with valid annotations by using @NotBlank for required fields (e.g. systemName and systemPurpose) and @Size to validate requests

I also modified the controller to use @Valid annotation and added an exception handler that returns HTTP 400 for bad requests and error messages

**API Documentation**

First, I added a springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui dependency to the pom.xml file

<img width="584" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-25 at 6 34 34 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c4f7bb1-6d05-4247-a7e9-70637ad7c3ed" />

Added documentation to the controller by using @Tag for API grouping, @Operation for endpoint description, and @ApiResponses for possible responses

<img width="748" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-25 at 6 40 55 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15a4bf7d-2b9c-44a5-ac8a-3ee57b31b959" />

Added documentation to the request and response classes by using @Schema to enhance documentation for API and Swagger UI (I also added examples for better understanding

<img width="716" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-25 at 6 48 11 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8110db31-0aed-42a1-acc5-0af80c3932a4" />

Now I can run Swagger UI on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html, and everything seems to work properly (the correct endpoints are visible)
