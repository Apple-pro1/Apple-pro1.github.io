Learning the bean container
## **Day 4**

On Day 4 I learned about the significance of the Bean Container, Inversion of Control, Get Beans, and about the most frequently used Spring Bean annotations. 

*Bean Container*
Beans are a crucial factor of a Spring Framework, but in order to utilise this concept I had to comprehend the fundamentals of how the Bean operates. 
Spring Beans:
is an object that forms the backbone of an application that is managed by the Spring IoC container. Moreover, the bean is formed and managed by the Spring IoC container, and the bean is like an component of a application.

*Inversion of Control*
The Inversion of Control occures when a bean exploits its feature when an object defines the dependencies of the bean (Inside a Spring)
Moreover, the Inversion of Control designates the job of constructing and developing dependancies to a IoC container.
e.g.)
A person has a property of an animal, but suppose that animal has two distinct properties: name and age. Then, to instantiate a person (an object), we will have to follow the procedures listed below:

This shows that the two classes are coagulated and if the animal's property changes, the person's property will change proportionally. Therefore, the use of the Inversion of Control is convenient because an object can retrieve its own dependencies from an LoC container, instead of constructing them again.

In order to pursue that particular task I would need to provide the container with an appropriate configuration (metadata)

e.g.)

*Get Bean*
In a Spring container there are several implementaions you can use by the use of different signatures.
- By name: the name returns an object if a bean with the identical name exist

- By name and type: the name and a type returns a bean of a specific type if it does exists. Moreover, this may be useful to aviod to cast the object when returned

- By type: with the use of this I can find more beans with the same type

- By name with constructor parameter: with the use of this I can pass the bean's name and its constructor paremeters:

Then, we will get an animal named Fuffy with an age of 5

- By type with constructor parameter: instead of the name the system will have to pass the ype and the bean can not be a singleton

The 5 methods listed above are the most ubiquitously used algorithms because the BeanFactory interface gives the beans from the container.
