$ Process Journal (first person perspective)
- ## **Day 1**
Through the class session I have reviewed familiar and unprecedented topics simultaneously: HTTP, Client-Server, RESTful and git. Initially, I downloaded required applications to puruse my tasks, including intellij, java, git, iterm, etc... To review, *HTTP* is the abbreviation for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is used for the communication for browsing web. Moreover, HTTPS significantly correlates to the "client-sever" concept because the client forms an HTTP request according to a web server, that a server responds. 

Also, the URL is a ubiquitously conecept as it is well known. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator whcih is used to identify resources on a web. There are 4 factors incorporated in the URL, the protocol, domain, path and parameter, and they are crucial because they determine the allocation of the server. In order to operate the HTTP, the request needs a method where the four methods are
- GET (read)
- PUT (update)
- POST (create)
- DELETE (delete)

The HTTP request is divided in to 3 correlated parts in conjuction with the 4 factors, they get, request and use a HTTP version to operate a server. Furthermore, there are status Codes from 1xx-5xx informing the requester the status of the requsted HTTP.

The *Representational state transfer* (REST) contained the instantaneous stat of a system resource through the use of requests and responses. Like the HTTP, the REST has 4 contributing factors: Create, Read, Update and Delete. 

*Client-Server* is a model that describes how a sever provides resources and services to several clients. Each distinct servers provide resources to requested devices; therefore, the majority of servers have more than one relationships with the client.

- ##**Day 2**##
"*Git* is a free and open source distributed version control system." Moreover, the git is capable of storing projects and files as they change over time with the contribution of diverse users. Therefore, the git progressively alters the updates on a repository, and a repository has commites to the project or references called heads. 

I have created a new repository to record our data sets and work. In order to create a repository, I used iterm with the commaneds stated on the slides.

Additionally, the Git has 5 vital codes used form branches:
- CLONE: download
- PUSH: upload and sync
- PULL: download with sync
- FETCH: refresh the state of remote repository
- COMMIT: save local changes

Consequently, I have formed, merged, altered a branch/repository according to the class session.

- ##**Day 3**##

*Github blog:* on day 3 I created a reposity for a potential blog, and it was intriguing that github noticed my intention of creating a blog. Therefore, the fundementals of a blog was automatically updated by github. In order to create a blog I used the 5 factors of the git, especially "commit" because I was commiting a new repository. 

To continue the process I had to confirm if "ruby" and "gem" was installed, then I attempted to install "jekyll" and "bundler" as they are crucial resources. However, there was an inevitable error, but the potential trouble was anticipated by the teacher; therefore, we were able to pursue our tasks without squandering time. Moreover, the problem was exacerbated after another error was induced, the CLT error. After fixing all errors, we browsed for Jekyll themes, and installed the most eligible theme. 

Then, I transfered the "index.html" to my personal repository. After initialising a blog I commited and pushed the file to create a blog. Furthermore, I created a post in order to blog my process journal. 

*Spring Boot:*
I have setup spring boot according to the instructions, unzipping the folder to open it on IntelliJ. Then I learned about the packages, and added them to begin our API session.
- ##**Day 4**##

On Day 4 I learned about the significance of the Bean Container, Inversion of Control, Get Beans, and about the most frequently used Spring Bean annotations. 

*Bean Container*
Beans are a crucial factor of a Spring Framework, but in order to utilise this concept I had to comprehend the fundamentals of how the Bean operates. 
Spring Beans:
is an object that forms the backbone of an application that is managed by the Spring IoC container. Moreover, the bean is formed and managed by the Spring IoC container, and the bean is like an component of a application.

*Inversion of Control*
The Inversion of Control occures when a bean exploits its feature when an object defines the dependencies of the bean (Inside a Spring)
Moreover, the Inversion of Control designates the job of constructing and developing dependancies to a IoC container.
e.g.)
A person has a property of an animal, but suppose that animal has two distinct properties: name and age. Then, to instantiate a person (an object), we will have to follow the procedures listed below:

This shows that the two classes are coagulated and if the animal's property changes, the person's property will change proportionally. Therefore, the use of the Inversion of Control is convenient because an object can retrieve its own dependencies from an LoC container, instead of constructing them again.

In order to pursue that particular task I would need to provide the container with an appropriate configuration (metadata)

e.g.)

*Get Bean*
In a Spring container there are several implementaions you can use by the use of different signatures.
- By name: the name returns an object if a bean with the identical name exist
<img width="573" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-25 at 12 00 30 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/115978950-d5d77000-a5bd-11eb-8991-1012b045a144.png">

- By name and type: the name and a type returns a bean of a specific type if it does exists. Moreover, this may be useful to aviod to cast the object when returned

- By type: with the use of this I can find more beans with the same type

<img width="573" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-25 at 12 02 55 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/115978995-2c44ae80-a5be-11eb-8533-fc8197e61436.png">

- By name with constructor parameter: with the use of this I can pass the bean's name and its constructor paremeters:

<img width="587" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-25 at 12 03 57 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/115979010-51392180-a5be-11eb-8ccc-8028866b7d9f.png">

Then, we will get an animal named Fuffy with an age of 5

- By type with constructor parameter: instead of the name the system will have to pass the ype and the bean can not be a singleton

<img width="569" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-25 at 12 05 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/115979033-86457400-a5be-11eb-910b-c42445a3548c.png">

The 5 methods listed above are the most ubiquitously used algorithms because the BeanFactory interface gives the beans from the container.
