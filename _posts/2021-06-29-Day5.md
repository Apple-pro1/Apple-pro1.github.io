Application of controller, service, and repository pattern

## **Day 5**

On Day 5 I learned about the relevance of the Controller, Service, Repository Pattern, H2 DB Setup, Entity Class, Repository Class, Entity Manager, and the ER Diagram. 


*Controller, Service, Repository Pattern*
- The Controllor has a layer which contains the application logic, and the logic maps the user's request to particular function. Then, passes the input to a service layer in order to apply to a business logic:

- The Service layer is located between the controller and the repository which performs the business and validation logic, and we can see the connection between them because the controller passes the user input to the service layer, then passes it to the repository after applying the business layer.

- Difference of the Business and application logic

The Business logic addresses the logical manipulations relevant to the business domain; therefore, I can infer that the business logic is specific to the business layer.

Despite the function of the business logic, the application logics represents the application level operators, which is specific to the application.


- The Repository is the layer which interacts with the database (CRUD) operations aimd the data access objects (DAOs)


- THe model is the simple POJO class which acts as the DTA and DAO

Today I learned about the Repository, Model and the database, as I have already covered up the topics before.


*H2 DB Setup*

After downloading the H2 DB I ran h2.sh in the terminal:

Then, I had to setup the H2 DB

<img width="631" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-02 at 2 55 23 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/116804012-6d0c6c80-ab56-11eb-9a48-cb1f26cad4d6.png">

After completly preparing H2 DB, I have added a dependency to "build.gradle"

<img width="471" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-02 at 2 56 24 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/116804031-9200df80-ab56-11eb-9e4e-8ee3e8b6d9f2.png">

Then, I have created a "application.yaml" in src/main/resources

<img width="458" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-02 at 2 57 04 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/116804040-a9d86380-ab56-11eb-9fb1-d3af42ed965e.png">


*Lombok Setup*

As, Lombok was already installed and updated, I added a dependency to build.gradle

<img width="679" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-02 at 2 58 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/116804067-d7251180-ab56-11eb-9346-bccbce6cfb51.png">

Then, I enabled the annotation process

*ER Diagram*

<img width="505" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-02 at 3 00 06 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/116804090-16536280-ab57-11eb-935b-1f914aa7c3d1.png">

- One to One Relationship

A diagram has a one to one relationship when a row in a table is related to another row in another table

This relationship can be created by using the Primary key-unique foreign key constraints

<img width="334" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-02 at 3 02 12 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/116804133-60d4df00-ab57-11eb-82d7-604e7a6d8eda.png">


- One to Many Relationship

This concept is similar to the one to one relationship, but this relationship is where a row from a table can have multiple relationships with rows in another table

This relationship can be created by using the Primary key-foreign key relationship.

<img width="372" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-02 at 3 04 01 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/116804169-a1ccf380-ab57-11eb-9ddc-cdaff3c1a412.png">


- Many to Many Relationship

This is where a row from a table can have multiple matching rows with row in another table, and a row from another table can also have multiple matching row with the first table.

This relationship can be created by using a thrid table called the Juction table or the Bridging table

*Entity Class*
Member Class

- @Entity

The JPA specification required the @Entity annotation because it indentifies a class as a entity class:

<img width="370" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-02 at 3 09 12 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/116804256-5bc45f80-ab58-11eb-8f94-5efa0bb6aabf.png">

- @Id

The JPA and Hibernate required me to specify a primary key attribute for each entity, and I did this by annotating an attribute with the @Id notation:

<img width="372" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-02 at 3 11 10 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/116804287-a219be80-ab58-11eb-95b8-a9518dc46f17.png">

- @GeneratedValue

When a primary key is specified, the sequences and the auto-incremented database cloumns also has to be specified.

Also, the 2 most frequently used DB generates unique primary key values:

- @Getter and @Setter

A field is annotated with the @Getter and @Setter, which allows the lombok to automatically generate the default getter and setter:

*Repository Class & Entity Manager*

<img width="605" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-02 at 3 14 59 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73371470/116804376-29ffc880-ab59-11eb-9c4a-28b0766d9019.png">

- @Persistence context

The transaction persistence context is bound to the transaction

Also, the entities contained in the persistence context are flushed into the persistent storage(DB) when the transaction finishes:

- @Repository

The @Repository is a Spring notation which indicates the decorated class of a repository

Moreover, a repository is a mechanism for encapsulating storage, retrieval and the search behavior which emulates a collection of a object 

Also, the @Repository specializes the @Component notaion because it allows the @Component
to implement classes which is autodetected through a classpath scan:
