Decison making process

## **Day 6**


Today, I brainstormed a few ideas on deciding a project to work on. I listed out common aspects of society, like schools, jobs, tech, etc, then I researched about their flaws in order to create a service that can patch them. However, several ideas were already innovated to secure any flaws or inconveniences. Therefore, I moved on to making a service that can be approachable by all individuals in order to attract clients.

- Coding Idea

*Music:*

Emotion choosing (when the web or app is opened), then recommending a list of songs

Or

Weather API of location, then recommending songs relevant to the weather

But, the topic does not have to be limited to music, the emotion and weather values can output another topic, like videos, etc
