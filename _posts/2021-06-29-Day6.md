Decison making process

## **Day 6**


Today, I have brain stormed for a significant amount of time on deciding a project to work on for the next semester. I listed out ubiquitous parts of humanity, like schools, jobs, tech, etc, then I research about the flaws of the prominate factors of life in order to create a service that can secure the flaws. However, several ideas were already innovated to secure any flaws or inconvenience. Therefore, I moved on to making a service which is approachable by all individuals in order to increase clients.

- Coding Idea

*Music:*

Emotion choosing (when the web or app is opened), then recommending a list of songs

Or

Weather API of location, then recommending songs relevant to the weather

But, the topic does not have to be limited to music, the emotion and weather values can output another topic, like videos, etc
