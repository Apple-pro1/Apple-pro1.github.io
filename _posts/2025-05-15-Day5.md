# Introduction

Today, I worked on completing the recommendations method by using a simple List method "add" to add specific recommendations according to the user's AI system's risk category.

## Development Notes

For the high-risk case, I referred to sections 2-5 of chapter 3 of EU AI Act to parse out recommendations.

Then, I referred to chapter 50 of chapter 4 for the limited risk case, and articles 53-56 of chapter 5 for the minimal risk case.

I also created a simple helper method to print the recommendations in the recommendations list using a for loop.

Running a sample run for a high-risk case, the program properly prints our recommendations for a high-risk AI system.

Moving forward, I will add a method to print out all the requirments into an external file and begin planning out a framework for the frontend.
