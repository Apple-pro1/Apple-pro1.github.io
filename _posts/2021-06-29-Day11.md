$ Process Journal (first person perspective)

- ## **Day 11**

Instead of proceeding towards APIs, I focused on securing mistakes and errors from the JUnit test cases. There were some noticeable errors, such as import neglection and establishment; perhaps, securing these errors, before proceed, may have saved me potential burdens that can occur later in the process. Fixing errors is crucial for effective work, espcially when work loads increase over bloster of requirments to my endeavor. For example, fixing an error may take about 5-10 minutes, but neglecting it then coming back to fix the burden would explicitly sacrifice my time. When it comes to test cases the burden may increase, as test cases are established to contigent, yet when I fail to do so, test cases may created double the burden to fix.

To be specific, the "Order Repository Test Case" comprimised most burden to solve; yet now errors are all adjourned.
