$ Sample system

- ## **Day 12**

- Today, I touched upon javascript and html in conjunction with the controller for api tests. To begin, I encoded a 'count up' system using the local host and ording the count to start from 0, then gaining 1 as the user clicks the button. As shown in the controller code "this.count ++" means to increase the count by one, and this maps to the html section which orders to count up when the button is click upon, "count-up-btn."

- Then, I advanced towards the add button system again with the use of the javascript, html, and controller. The java script requires two numbers to be inputted in order to caculate a sum, then when the caculation completes, the local host 'POSTS' the value. Also, the html file asks to input two numbers, then caculates them the user clicks the add button, "add-btn." Lastly, the controller requests to get A and B, then adds them up according to their code.
