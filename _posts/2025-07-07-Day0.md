# Fine-tuning a Small/Large Language Model

For the next few weeks, I will be fine-tuning a small language model (e.g. GPT-2 (124M parameters) or DistilBERT) to generate plain English explanations from Python code snippets.
- Week 1: Enviornment setup, data collection, and data pre-processing
- Week 2: Model selection and initial training
- Week 3: Training optimization and evaluation
- Week 4: Model refinement and deployment

The **end goal** is to publish/share the model on hugging face or deploy it on a web service. 

*I will locally train the model on my computer, but will consider migrating to Google Colabs if needed*
