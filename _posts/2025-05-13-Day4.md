# Introduction

Today, I worked on creating a skeleton framework for a compliance recommendation system for the user by using Lists and ArrayList.

## Development Notes

I built a private static method to take the riskCategory classified by the program and return a list of strings that includes tailored recommendation for each user.

I then call on this method in the main method to fill up the recommendations list.

I will work on creating the recommedations by refering to the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/)
