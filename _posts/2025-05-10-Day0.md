# Building the AI Ethics Sandbox

Over this summer, I will be working on building a Java-based simulator that models ethical decision-making in AI systems. The simulator will allow users to input different scenarios and observe how an AI system might make decisions based on configurable ethical frameworks.

**Proposed Core Features:**
- Scenario Input Interface
- Ethical Framework
- Decision Engine
- Visualization
- Audit Log

**Project Goals:**
- Understand how ethical principles can be encoded into algorithms
- Practice Java OOP, file I/O, and possibly ML development.
- Explore explainability and transparency in AI systems.
