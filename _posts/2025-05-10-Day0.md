# Building an AI Risk Classification System

This Java project is directly inspired by the [EU AI Act's](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) risk-based framework, which categorizes AI systems into different risk levels:
- Prohibited AI Systems - Systems that pose unacceptable risks
- High-Risk AI Systems - Systems that require strict compliance measures
- Limited Risk AI Systems - Systems with specific transparency requirements
- Minimal Risk AI Systems - Systems with minimal regulatory obligations

This application walks users through a series of questions about their AI system. Based on responses, it determines the appropriate risk category and provides specific compliance recommendations aligned with the EU AI Act's requirements.
