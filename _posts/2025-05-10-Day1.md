# Introduction

Today, I started out by research in-depth on the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/). This regulatory AI framework is known as the first binding comprehensive regulation on AI. At its current pace, the AI Act can become a global standard, meaning that countless AI systems will have to undergo compliance tests. Therefore, this java application aims to help AI system developers to understand where their software, product, etc falls on the AI Act's risk assessment.

## Development Notes
I created a EUAIActClassifier.java file to start writing code for this application. For today, I just drafted a prompt for the user.
