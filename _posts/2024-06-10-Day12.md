# Introduction

Today, I worked on creating a logo and fixing the header

## Development Notes

First of all, I edited my Header.tsx file to add my logo created from Canva via "const logo = require('./img/logo.png');" and then I add it next to the header name under the same div as img src={logo} alt="logo" className="header-logo"

<img width="654" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-10 at 10 48 30 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/242490f7-2b06-4ac0-91f1-fc7684882444" />

I also created a simple css for the header for the time being, but I will heavily revise it moving on

<img width="461" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-10 at 10 49 00 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/773d07f0-d504-4c71-93f1-8f94e46e35b1" />

Next, I will work on dividing the form into different pages. 

**Page Flow**
- Landing page for user to enter system name and purpose
- Loading screen with rotating logo
- Prohibited Assessment
- High-risk Assessment
- Transparency Assessment
- Loading screen with rotating logo
- Recommendations with option to export
