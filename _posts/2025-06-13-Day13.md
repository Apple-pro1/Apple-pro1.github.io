# Introduction

Today, I worked on creating a landing page for my AI Risk Auditor

## Development Notes

First, I installed the react router dom package so that I create an application that has many pages/components that can by directly fetched based on the URL.

On my App.tsx file, I imported necessary components and libraries inorder to add a router and routes to my different pages. For now, I assigned the landing page with the "/landing" root and the classification form page with the "/classification" root

At the moment, the landing page itself is very simple
- Title: Welcome to the AI Risk Auditor
- Subtitle: A tool to understand your AI system better
- Button: Auditor (*clicking on this button directs you to the classification form*)

Moving forward, I will create the basic structure for the remaning pages:
- Landing page for user to enter system name and purpose &#x2611;
- Loading screen with rotating logo
- Prohibited Assessment
- High-risk Assessment
- Transparency Assessment
- Loading screen with rotating logo
- Recommendations with option to export
