$ 5 vital Git codes
- ## **Day 2**
"*Git* is a free and open source distributed version control system." Moreover, the git is capable of storing projects and files as they change over time with the contribution of diverse users. Therefore, the git progressively alters the updates on a repository, and a repository has commites to the project or references called heads. 

I have created a new repository to record our data sets and work. In order to create a repository, I used iterm with the commaneds stated on the slides.

Additionally, the Git has 5 vital codes used form branches:
- CLONE: download
- PUSH: upload and sync
- PULL: download with sync
- FETCH: refresh the state of remote repository
- COMMIT: save local changes

Consequently, I have formed, merged, altered a branch/repository according to the class session.
