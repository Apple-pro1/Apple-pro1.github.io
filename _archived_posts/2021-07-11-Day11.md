Test cases and errors

## **Day 11**

Instead of proceeding towards APIs today, I focused on securing mistakes and errors from the JUnit test cases. There were some noticeable errors, such as import neglection and establishment. I believe that constant debugging is crucial because errors constantly stack up.

Debugging the "Order Repository Test Case" was complicated, but I was able to fix all the errors.
